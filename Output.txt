Treasury Management Strategy 2016-17 (AC/06/270116)  PDF 646 KB 
Additional documents:


2016-17 TM Strategy to AC App A , item 6.
 PDF 6 MB  

Minutes:

The Council’s treasury activities are
strictly regulated by statutory requirements and a Professional
Code of Practice - the Chartered Institute of Public Finance &
Accountancy (CIPFA) Code of Practice in Treasury
Management.  
 
One of the requirements of the Code of
Practice is for the Council to nominate a committee to undertake
the effective scrutiny of the proposed Treasury Management
Strategy. The Audit Committee has been nominated to undertake this
role and the Council’s Financial Standing Orders were revised
to incorporate this requirement by a resolution of Council on the
27 May 2010 minute (COU/07d/270510).    
 
The Treasury Management Strategy for 2016/17
is attached as Appendix A and comprises:
 

·        
The Borrowing Strategy for 2016/17 as set out in paragraphs 2 to
5;

·        
The Minimum Revenue Provision Policy Statement for 2016/17 as set
out in paragraph 6;

·        
The Annual Investment Strategy for 2016/17 as set out in paragraphs
7 to 14;

·        
The Prudential Indicators for Treasury Management as set out in
paragraph 15; and

·        
The Treasury Management Policy Statement as set out at Appendix 1
of the attached report.
 
The Audit Committee is recommended to support
the proposed Treasury Management Strategy.
 
During the discussion some of the main points
and comments raised by Members were as follows:-
 

·        
Members queried the New Borrowing Requirements in relation to the
Capital Programme and Housing Revenue Account in the schedule on
page 16 of the agenda. It was noted that the plans for borrowing
were based on capital receipts, the Housing in the budget was
linked to the General Fund Account;

·        
How had the recommended borrowing strategy in 2016/17 changed from
the 2015/16 borrowing strategy? It was noted that in the short term
for 2016/17 rather than borrowing, cash reserves were being used;
the council was not under any pressure to borrow;

·        
It has been Council policy for quite some time to make use of
internal borrowing;

·        
£30m is a continuing debt rather than a new debt.
 
Resolved: That we support the
proposed Treasury Management Strategy for 2016/17.

Review of Governance of the Transformation Agenda (AC/07/270116)  PDF 2 MB 
Minutes:

Part of the role of the Audit
Committee is to provide independent assurance on the adequacy of
the risk management framework and internal control
environment through its review of governance, risk and control
frameworks. Given the potentially significant impact of
transformation projects on structures and controls, the Audit
Committee considered that it needed assurance that these impacts
and risks were being appropriately assessed and at the right time
in the process.
 
At our meeting on
15th July 2015 we received a report on the
Council’s corporate transformation programme and the
governance and risk management processes in place to support this
work. At that meeting we requested that:
 

·        
the Internal Audit Plan should incorporate the auditing of the transformation agenda and
assurance that adequate management controls were in place to
minimise the risk to the programme; 
 

·        
we receive a report describing the role of Internal
Audit in the Transformation Programme; and also a report
summarising the revenue budget information relating to
transformation.
 
We subsequently received a
report on 16th September 2015 setting out how Internal
Audit would be involved in the Council’s transformation
programme.
 
This report provides us with an
update on additional governance and control measures put in place
since July 2015, provides the requested financial information and
confirms the findings of Internal Audit’s initial audit of
the corporate transformation programme.
 
During the discussion some of the main points
and comments raised by Members were as follows:-
 

·        
A programme of work had been agreed with Internal
Audit whereby, Internal Audit will come in at key milestones to
provide additional checks and challenge;

·        
The quarterly process of checking will involve self-
assessment against a template;

·        
There will be a project lead on each project who
would be responsible for completing the self- assessment and making
sure the framework is operating effectively;

·        
The sole role of the Project Management Officer
would be to manage risk and this would provide an added layer of
assurance;

·        
What assurance is there that the Transformation
Agenda has adequate resources and the projects are not going to
collapse?

·        
There is a Finance Officer working alongside the
Project Management Officer that provides an update on the financial
risk and identifies whether the physical resources to deliver the
project continues to be sustainable;

·        
The implementation costs are looked at and broken
down into some detail to include what it will take to deliver a
project;

·        
This is kept under review and reported to Management
Team;

·        
Where the Council does not have the in house skills
to deliver, some external resources are brought in;

·        
The external resources work alongside
staff;

·        
£4.2m savings have been generated and the aim
is that by 2016/17 the transformation agenda would deliver an on-
going saving;

·        
It was noted that redundancy costs are met centrally
and would be separate; There were questions around the invest to
save scheme and whether they were part of the proposals;

·        
Members queried whether there was a schedule which
highlighted how the Change Management Fund was performing and

Management of Partnership Risks  (AC/08/270116)  PDF 2 MB 
Minutes:

Further to our meeting of 25th
November 2015, we requested that a report about Partnership risk management
be brought to our next meeting to include particular detail about
the current work integrating Health and Social Services
 
This report is presented in accordance with
the above requirement and details the current arrangements in place
to monitor project risks around proposals associated with the
development of the integrated health and adult social care model.
It also details prospective partnership risk management
arrangements.
 
It was noted that:
 

·        
The report on integration had been through the Cabinet process and
had been fully consulted on by stakeholders;
 

·        
It was aimed at meeting key efficiency savings around the long term
of social care and health services
 
During the discussion some of the main points
and comments raised by Members were as follows:-

·        
Members requested practical examples of how things were going to
change and what would be different; It was noted that there would
be a number of multidisciplinary teams that would provide the needs
required in the locality. The referral process would involve
streamlining to a team;

·        
There was lots of information on the website and through Redbridge
first response service. A team would also be mobile within a
locality and it would stop users moving 
around between health and social care;

·        
Members asked how the information fed to the Board was fed into the
Local Authority; It was noted that the information was fed directly
into the Council’s structure process; The partnership
agreement was about collaboration and the Council’s Internal
Audit team carried out joint audits;

·        
Members were advised that a substantive report went to the
Council’s Cabinet in November 2015 providing a business case
and outlining the structure of the new service;

·        
The Council would be losing 53 posts while the NHS Foundation Trust
(NELFT) would go through a different process but would also be
losing staff; Officers advised that this would be offset by
synergy;

·        
How would this be monitored and reported back? This would continue
to evolve and develop, but flexibility would be built into the
process;

·        
How long would the Section 75 agreement be for? This would be for 3
years and if it was not working there was the option to exit. It
was more about working on the ground together;

·        
What would the process involve if NELFT came back and said a
different organisational structure was required? There would be
different ways of commissioning in the future and NELFT was
actively managed on the Council’s behalf;

·        
In terms of Audit arrangements there is the need for more of a
joint approach and will this be built into the Section 75
process;  

·        
There is the agreement of parties to have access to data and there
are protocols around the importance of access;

·        
It was noted the responsibility had been delegated to the Director
of Adult Social Services, Health and Wellbeing;

·        
Members noted that the Section 75 agreement was a very big
arrangement which the Council needed to pay  ...

Internal Audit Strategy and 2016-17 Annual Audit Plan  PDF 2 MB

Audit Plan 2016-2017 Adj Options_REVISED , item 9.
 PDF 141 KB  

Fraud Plan 2016-17 , item 9.
 PDF 147 KB  

Minutes:

The report sets out the Internal Audit
Strategy and proposed Annual Plan for 2016/17 which details how the
Council will meet its statutory requirements for Internal
Audit.
 
Members were advised that:
 

·        
The overall approach to delivering and monitoring the Internal
Audit function as set out in the report complied with the Public
Sector Internal Audit Standards (PSIAS).
 

·        
The report explained that the overall level of audit coverage had
been developed by applying a risk based approach. The overall
number of audit days had reduced by 12% on core audit coverage from
1,361 days to 1,200 days as a result of budget cuts. The impact on
audit coverage and assurance has been mitigated to some extent by a
review of the audit methodology with improved focus on risk
assessment at each stage of the audit process.
 

·        
The Audit Plan continues to focus upon areas of highest risk and
the overall coverage is considered to be sufficient to provide
Members, management and other external bodies with an independent
assurance on the adequacy of the Council’s risk management,
governance and internal control framework.
 

·        
We are requested to comment on the Internal Audit Strategy and the
overall shape of the Audit Plan for 2016/17 and to note that this
report will be submitted to Cabinet in March 2016 for
approval. 
 
During the discussion some of the main points
and comments raised by Members were as follows:-
 

·        
How has the school audit programme developed in view of the
National Academy Programme? It was noted that the school audits
were shrinking as schools became academies.

·        
As the changes are taking place there are certain elements of risk
which were not being addressed and there should be concerns with
the reduction of Audit days;

·        
Audit work had resulted in the recovery of 51 properties and it was
unwise from the Council’s point of view to reduce the number
of audit days;

·        
Cabinet should be asked to review the decision, the Council should
be investing to save; it was noted that the Council was focussed on
areas which would deliver the maximum value;

·        
Members felt that another auditor would assist the Council in
achieving more savings; 

·        
Members were advised that Audit was moving away from the
traditional type of role whereby something was done to people and
were now adopting a more collaborative approach where there was one
to one engagement with risk management flagging up issues and areas
of concern, it was noted that there was a huge benefit to be had
from developing this process;

·        
Members discussed the requirement for more resources to develop the
risk management process and invest to save in terms of anti- fraud
work;

·        
In response to Members questions the Chief Internal Auditor advised
that the Council would get significant benefit from increasing the
area of risk management.
 
On conclusion of the discussion:
 
The Chair proposed the
following motions:
 
(1)
recommend that ‘Cabinet be requested to consider
reviewing the Council’s overall resource capacity for anti-
fraud work in the context of invest  ...

Review of Committee Terms of Reference (AC/10/270116)  PDF 967 KB 
Minutes:

It was noted that:
 

·        
A review of the Council’s terms of reference for the Audit
Committee against current good practice as detailed within
the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy (CIPFA) publication, the revised ‘Audit
Committees - Practical Guidance for Local Authorities and
Police’ (December 2013) had shown that the Audit Committee’s terms of reference remain relevant and
were in line with up to date guidance.
 

·        
The terms of reference for the Council’s Audit Committee are
attached at Appendix 1, page 84 of the agenda. The areas of
responsibility for the committee are summarised in section 4 of the
terms of reference. The CIPFA suggested terms of reference,
included at Appendix 2, page 85 of the agenda provide more detail
of what each area covers.  Whilst this
extra detail is considered useful to explain the committee’s
role in each area, it is not considered necessary to alter the
existing terms of reference as all areas of responsibility are
captured in sufficient detail to provide a clear high level summary
of the work of the committee.
 
Resolved: That we
 
(i) note the terms of
reference for the Audit Committee as set out in Appendix 1of the
report; and
 
(ii) Note that CIPFA’s suggested terms
of reference for an Audit Committee are adequately captured within
the Council’s terms of reference.

2014-15 Annual Certification of Grants and Returns (AC/11/270116)  PDF 375 KB 
Additional documents:


Redbridge annual grants report 1415_final , item 11.
 PDF 303 KB  

Minutes:

We were advised that:
 

·        
The 2014/15 Certification Report had been issued by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the Council’s external auditors
for the 2014/15 Accounts process.  This
Report summarised the results of the certification work undertaken
last year. 
 

·        
In 2014/15 only the Housing Benefit Subsidy claim
was subject to certification by PwC. 
The certification work undertaken did not highlight any major
issues.
 

·        
The Housing Benefit Subsidy claim amounted to around
£152 million and only some minor amendments were made to it
relating to a few cases that were identified during the audit. The
final claim has been settled in full and no monies required to be
returned.
 

·        
Housing Benefit is a complex scheme and claimants
often make a number of changes each year.  Given that only very few errors were identified in
relation to both the large volume of claimants and the overall size
of claim these errors are therefore not considered to be a
significant issue.  The Chief Payments
and Benefits Officer has advised that there is a continuous
programme of refresher training to all Housing Benefit staff and
that regular management checks are carried out.
 
In addition to the above three other claims
and returns were required to be audited by independent
auditors.  These were the Housing
Capital Receipts return, the Teachers’ Pensions return and
the GLA funding of projects. These audits were undertaken by Mazars
LLP and in all cases no material issues were raised and assurance
reports duly issued.
 
Resolved: That we note the
2014/15 Annual Certification Report.

Progress in Implementing Red Risk Recommendations  (AC/12/270116)  PDF 1 MB 
Additional documents:

 PDF 14 KB  

Minutes:

The report sets out the progress made by
management in implementing red risk recommendations relating to
audit reviews completed to the end of December 2015.
 

·        
Since the last report to the
Committee on 25th November 2015 management have provided
assurance that 3 red risk recommendations have been
implemented.
 

·        
This means that since 1st April 2015 the
total number of red risk recommendations implemented is
24.
 

·        
Management were making progress in implementing
these important red risk recommendations and are continuing to
improve system controls and compliance.  
 

·        
Based upon the information provided by
management, as well as Internal Audit
follow up work, 56 red risk recommendations raised by Internal
Audit have not as yet been implemented by management, albeit some
are not yet due to be implemented.
 
It was noted that by their
nature, red risk recommendations often require prompt management
action and therefore, Internal Audit had established a programme of
follow up work, obtained revised management action plans where
necessary and sought assurance from management that they had
mitigated the risks associated with the non- implemented
recommendations, where appropriate. 
 
The Chief Internal Auditor
advised that since the last meeting there had been three audit
reports finalised with no assurance. These included:

·        
the HMA direct payment review within Adult Social
Services;

·        
Housing Service Contracts within Environment
Services; and

·        
the Music Service within Services to Young
People.
 
It was noted that an update on
the Direct Payments report will be presented to our next meeting in
April 2016.
 
It was reported that with
regards to the Housing Services contracts the processes in place
were woefully inadequate and there were a number of failings.
Members expressed serious concerns and requested that the Director
for this service provide assurance that proper controls had been
put in place to address the issues raised.
 
Members requested that the
Director of Environment and Community Services attend our next
meeting to go through the agreed recommendations, to explain what
they were doing to address the issues raised.
 
Members also requested that the
Chief Internal Auditor review the escalation procedure process for
non-compliance of red risk recommendations and report back to the
Audit Committee.  
 

Resolved: That we (i) note the progress of
management in the implementation of red risk
recommendations;
 
(ii) request that the Director of Environment and Community
Services attend our next meeting in April 2016 to explain how each
of the outstanding matters identified in the audit of Housing
Services Contracts are going to be resolved; and
 
(iii) that the Chief Internal Auditor review the escalation
procedures for reporting red risk recommendations and report back
to our Committee.
